## Context:
This project was a fun way to test my ability to work with code and to have it placed where it needs to function properly. I had to think out side the box for most of this project since I decided not to work with a class to update the data model and DOM. It was a little tricky but in the end I got it to work.

## Learning Goals:
Write clean, DRY JavaScript using functions and iterations. Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding to my data model and updating elements on the DOM

## Wins + Challenges:
Wins: Technical Wins included: Setting up the errors for the add a recipe button was difficult. I first started out with a function with no less than 13 if statement, but I quickly realized that I couldn't get it to fully function how I wanted it to. 
Challenges included: The same technical win was the challenge. It took me a while to get the functionality to work and went through multiple iterations to get it to work.
